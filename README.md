This is a collection of slides of my talks at Nanjing University ICPC Training Team. 

## Geometry

Date: August 8, 2019

Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

This talk discusses the principles and practices of solving geometry problems. It proposes three guidelines in writing geometry problems:

1. Prefer vectors to parameters in equations when representing geometric objects;
2. Use integer arithmetics whenever possible;
3. Think twice before tuning epsilon.

It also presents three algorithmic paradigms on solving geometry problems:

1. Triangle/trapezoid partition (a powerful tool to compute double integral over a polygon);
2. Enumerating local optima (a very useful technique to deal with geometric optimization problems);
3. (Rotational) sweep line (a key technique to solve various geometry problems).

## trees

Date: June 9, 2019

Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

This talk mainly focuses on the restricted version of three classic problems in graph theory:

1. Graph Isomorhism;
2. Subgraph Isomorphism;
3. Maximum Isomorphic Subgraphs.

While all these problems are NP-Hard on general graphs, they are all polynomially solvable on trees. The basic technique to solve the last two problems on trees is to use dynamic programming to decompose the problem into several instances of bipartite matching problem.
